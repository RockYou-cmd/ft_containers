# ft_containers
In this project, I will implement a few container types of the C++ standard template library.
we'll talk about some essential concepts before diving into the implementation of containers :
# Exception safety is
Exception safety is a programming concept that refers to the ability of a program to handle and recover from exceptions (unexpected errors or conditions) without causing memory leaks, data corruption, or other side effects. Exception safety is important because when an exception occurs, it can disrupt the normal flow of control in a program, and if the program is not prepared to handle the exception, it can lead to unpredictable and undesirable consequences.

There are three main levels of exception safety:

1 . Basic exception safety: This level ensures that the program will not crash or leak memory if an exception is thrown. However, the program's state may be left in an indeterminate state after the exception is handled.

2 . Strong exception safety: This level guarantees that the program's state will be left in a consistent state, even if an exception is thrown. This means that all memory and resources used by the program will be properly cleaned up, and the program will not crash or leak memory.

3 . No-throw exception safety: This level ensures that the program will not throw any exceptions, even in the event of an error. This is often achieved by using error codes or status flags instead of exceptions.

Achieving exception safety can require a lot of effort and attention to detail, but it is an important aspect of designing robust and reliable software.
